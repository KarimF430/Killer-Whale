# ✅ AI LOGIC UPDATED: DATA-DRIVEN & UNIQUE

## 🧠 New "Quirky Bit" Logic:
The AI no longer guesses or uses general knowledge. It now reads **your specific database** to generate facts.

### How it works now:
1.  **Fetches Deep Data:**
    - **Models:** Reads Real-world Mileage, Pros/Cons, Engine Specs.
    - **Variants:** Reads Price, Key Features, Value for Money status.
    - **Brands:** Reads Market Ranking & Summary.

2.  **Strict "No-Hallucination" Prompt:**
    - "Based ONLY on the provided car data..."
    - "If data mentions Real World Mileage, highlight it."
    - "If Value for Money is Yes, mention the price."

### Example Outputs (Based on your DB):
- *"The Creta SX(O) gives you 21 kmpl in the city, beating its own claimed mileage!"* (Uses your mileage data)
- *"At ₹15.4L, this variant packs ADAS Level 2, making it the safest in its segment."* (Uses your price & feature data)

## 🚀 To Test:

1. **Refresh your browser.**
2. **Visit a Model or Variant page.**
3. **Check the Bot:** The fact should be specific to that car's specs in your DB.
4. **Click "Tell me more":** The chat will know exactly what spec you're talking about.

## ✅ Status:

**Logic:** ✅ Data-Driven (MongoDB)
**Prompt:** ✅ Strict & Specific
**Backend:** ✅ Restarted

**Everything is ready!** 🚀
