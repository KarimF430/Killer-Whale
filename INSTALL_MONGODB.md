## 🔄 **Step 5: Run Migration**

Once MongoDB is running, migrate your data:

```bash
cd /Applications/WEBSITE-23092025-101/backend
npm run migrate
```

Expected output:
```

- Click "Create Cluster"

### **3. Create Database User:**
- Go to "Database Access"
- Click "Add New Database User"
- Choose "Password" authentication
- Username: `gadizone`
- Password: (generate strong password)
- User Privileges: "Read and write to any database"
- Click "Add User"

### **4. Whitelist IP:**
- Go to "Network Access"
- Click "Add IP Address"
- Choose "Allow Access from Anywhere" (for development)
- Click "Confirm"

### **5. Get Connection String:**
- Go back to "Database"
- Click "Connect" on your cluster
- Choose "Connect your application"
- Copy the connection string:
  ```
  mongodb+srv://gadizone:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/gadizone
  ```
- Replace `<password>` with your actual password

### **6. Update .env File:**
```bash
# Edit: /Applications/WEBSITE-23092025-101/backend/.env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://gadizone:YOUR_PASSWORD@cluster.mongodb.net/gadizone
```

### **7. Run Migration:**
```bash
cd /Applications/WEBSITE-23092025-101/backend
npm run migrate
npm run dev
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

### **MongoDB Won't Start:**
```bash
# Check logs
brew services info mongodb-community@8.0

# Restart service

# Check if MongoDB is running
ps aux | grep mongod

# Check MongoDB logs
tail -f /usr/local/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log
```

### **Port Already in Use:**
