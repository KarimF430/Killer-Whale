RULES:
1. Sound like a car enthusiast explaining to a friend, NOT like marketing copy
2. Mention 1-2 popular models
3. Mention what they're known for (strength)
4. Keep it conversational - use "they're", "you'll find", etc.
5. NO generic phrases like "innovative technology" or "customer satisfaction"
6. About 60-80 words total
7. No emojis or bullet points

Example tone: "Kia's only been in India since 2019, but they've made quite an impression. The Seltos basically took the mid-size SUV segment by storm, and the Sonet isn't far behind. What sets them apart? Loaded features at prices that undercut the competition. Their cars look sharp, drive well, and you get stuff like ventilated seats in variants where others wouldn't even think of offering them."
